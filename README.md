Python codes for my book in Thai
"Applicaiton of Numerical methos for mathematical modelling with Python" 

There are two parts in the book which numerical methods and model examples in 12 chapters.

First part: numerical methods- system of linear equations, system of nonlinear equations, interpolation, derivative and integral approximation, and initial value problems

Second part: modelling- growth model of linear and logistic model, predator-prey, Lorenz system, heat transfer, Monte Carlo simulation by queuing process, 
environmental modelling with DO and BOD interaction along a river.

Special part of COVID-19, a case study in China is also presented.
